#+title: pathtr

Path tracers are neat.

* Running

#+begin_src bash
# -p makes the preview window appear
cargo run --release -- -p
#+end_src

* What is this?

This is a small path tracer experiment. I've been working on it off and on (mostly off) since 2017.

** Features

- Global illumination (only)
- Depth of field simulation
- Live preview
- Parallel rendering

** Non-features

- Dynamic scenes
- Good scaling
- Particularly good performance
